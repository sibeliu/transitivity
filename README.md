This code reads Mesopotamian and Biblical sacred texts and characterizes them by verb transitivity

The script depends on SpaCy parsing software to distinguish parts of speech in the text.
ATFparse compares the Shuila prayers to the Psalms according to a variety of metrics: keyness, verb frequency, adjective frequency, and attempts to cluster these terms using k-means clustering. The most robust results of this analysis are published at https://4banks.net/Mes-Rel/temi/transitivity.htm
